  <h1  style="text-align: center;"> Schools That I Have Attended</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Brett Peek</h2>
	<p><strong>Grade School: </strong>I started off in Pre-K at Johnson Elementary School. From there I went to Model from 1st grade until 7th. Model is in Rome where I am from. Practically my whole family on my mom's side went to Model. From 8th grade and throughout high school I went to Calhoun where I graduated.</p>
<p><strong>First College: </strong>The college I first attended out of high school was a junior college called Georgia Highlands.&nbsp; I attended both the Cartersville campus as well as the Rome campus. Georgia Highlands has three more campuses in Douglasville, Paulding, and Marietta.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">UGA: This is my first semester at the University of Georgia. I plan to graduate from UGA and the Terry College of Business.&nbsp; My major is Management Information System. Attending the University of Georgia has been an incredible experience thus far.</span></strong></p>
